Subject: Hi John!!
Hi John! I hope you’re well!
Coming to you from BlackRock now! I miss talking to you guys on the Boston business at
Hamilton Lane, I hope things are going smoothly. They will be extremely helpful in
developing and executing the plan I’m sure of it. If you have any questions or concerns on
that front, please reach out to me and I’m sure I can be helpful.
One quick question from my side. Now that I’m here at BlackRock, I’m trying got be helpful
to them on the Mass Public Pensions and how to work with the plan directly as well as work
closely with PERAC. To that end, there is a live example that BlackRock has some
questions on. Specifically, as it relates to the active RFP MWRA has targeting secondaries
investments.
BlackRock would like to respond to the RFP but wants to make sure they are doing
everything they can to satisfy the PERAC disclosures.
Would you mind getting on the phone with me and a colleague from BlackRock just to
answer a few short questions related to the disclosures at the front-end of an RFP process?
Thanks so much in advance John, I really appreciate it.
Be well,
TD

Public Records Request – PERAC Investment Records 2024–2025

Message Body

Good Morning Mr. Stebbins,

 

PERAC has received your below Public Records Request; however, we are unable to comply with a majority of said request as PERAC itself does not conduct any type of investments. 

 

PERAC is the regulatory agency that oversees the 104 retirement systems in the Commonwealth.  We assist the retirement boards and ensure that our retirement law, Chapter 32, is applied uniformly throughout the systems.  PERAC itself does not enter into or handle any investments.  Each of the 104 retirement boards conduct their own investments and handle the management of the funds of that system.  As such, we are unable to supply any investment schedules or asset allocation reports.

 

I have attached copies of 2 emails between PERAC and Blackrock, but again, these are only advisory emails about responding to RFPs sent out by retirement boards. 

 

I would suggest that you send this request to each of the 104 retirement systems to see if any of them can provide the information that you seek.  I would also suggest sending this request to the Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment Management (IPRIM) Board as they are the ones that handle investing funds of certain retirement boards.

 

Best,

To: Felicia McGinniss, Esq.

Senior Associate General Counsel

Public Employee Retirement Administration Commission (PERAC)




Dear Ms. McGinniss,


Thank you for your response and for providing the two emails between PERAC and BlackRock. I appreciate your time and transparency.


However, after carefully reviewing these emails and cross-referencing them with public records and vendor access logs, I now have several follow-up questions and requests for clarification. These are based on inconsistencies between your written statements and the role PERAC appears to play in pension vendor coordination and disclosures.





🔍 

Clarification Questions



    Vendor Coordination and Investment Gatekeeping
        Why is PERAC advising vendors such as BlackRock on how to respond to individual retirement board RFPs if PERAC does not conduct or influence investments?
        What legal or regulatory authority allows PERAC to instruct vendors on compliance for board-specific RFPs (e.g., MWRA)?
        How frequently does PERAC correspond directly with private investment firms about open RFPs?

    PROSPER Portal Access
        What data fields or modules within the PROSPER portal were accessed by BlackRock employees?
        Are outside vendors’ portal access logs retained? If so, I formally request them for the BlackRock accounts added in the attached emails.
        Under what criteria does PERAC grant vendor access to PROSPER?

    Undisclosed Investment Influence
        How many vendors have contacted PERAC to clarify or satisfy PERAC disclosures before responding to RFPs over the last 5 years?
        Is PERAC involved in the review, guidance, or approval of investment firms participating in retirement board selections?
        Has PERAC ever provided verbal guidance or informal steering that is not documented in email or written form?

    Disclosure Gaps and Transparency Compliance
        Do PERAC officers or contractors (e.g., John Galvin) attend investment committee meetings or vendor pitches, even informally?
        Does PERAC maintain internal records of vendor-related communications that are not cataloged under public procurement systems?
        Has PERAC coordinated with third-party platforms such as BlackRock, Hamilton Lane, or PRIM to shape or influence RFP outcomes?






📑 

Public Records Request Expansion



In accordance with Massachusetts public records law, I hereby formally request:


    All communications (email, internal memos, meeting notes) between PERAC employees and any vendor or investment firm from 2018 to 2025 that reference:
        PROSPER portal access
        RFP responses or disclosures
        BlackRock, PRIM, Hamilton Lane, or any vendor managing public retirement funds

    All access logs to the PROSPER system from external IP addresses or users affiliated with investment vendors, including but not limited to:
        BlackRock
        Hamilton Lane
        State Street
        Vanguard
        PRIM-affiliated firms

    All internal policies, memos, or training materials that:
        Define PERAC’s role in vendor guidance
        Explain what constitutes “investment influence” or “advisory capacity” within PERAC’s compliance obligations






⚠️ 

Notice of Legal and Public Oversight Interest



Due to the serious financial and ethical implications of possible undisclosed influence over public retirement funds, this request is part of a larger transparency initiative involving oversight bodies, investigative journalists, and legal analysts.


If PERAC has in any way misrepresented its level of involvement in pension investment decisions or vendor guidance, that would constitute a breach of public trust with implications under state ethics and procurement laws (e.g., M.G.L. c. 268A and c. 30B).


This is not a generic fishing expedition. It is a focused inquiry into patterns of selective access, behind-the-scenes gatekeeping, and potential conflicts of interest affecting millions in public retirement assets.


I respectfully ask that you treat this request with the seriousness it deserves.




Sincerely,

Ricky Stebbins

Good Afternoon Mr. Stebbins,

 

PERAC is in receipt of your additional questions and request.  Based on the questions below, this request has diverged from a general Public Records Request.  As such, PERAC will be opening this as an official “opinion letter” so that we may send you out a more detailed letter addressing each of your questions.  We will also provide any and all records that we can that is pursuant to your second request.

 

At this time, it will take us at least 2 months to compile all the requested records since it is almost 10 years of documentation and provide a detailed, written response.  We will send out the official letter and documents via first class mail to your address listed in your email.

 

Please let me know if you have any questions in the meantime.

Mr. Stebbins:

 

This responds to your public records request (below) to the Massachusetts Civil Service Commission.

 

On July 7, 2025, you submitted to the Commission the following request: “Under the Massachusetts Public Records Law, M.G.L. c. 66, I am requesting access to the following public records: All investment schedules and asset allocation reports from January 1, 2024, to present related to the Massachusetts Public Employee Retirement Administration Commission (PERAC), specifically including: BlackRock Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) holdings, including but not limited to crypto ETFs[;] Investments in cryptocurrency mining companies, including but not limited to Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital Holdings, and Bitdeer Technologies. All communications, meeting minutes, and correspondence from January 1, 2024, to present between PERAC officials and: Larry Fink (BlackRock CEO)[,] Maura Healey (Governor of Massachusetts)[,] Representatives of BlackRock[,] Representatives of cryptocurrency companies[.]”

 

The Civil Service Commission is a quasi-judicial appellate board whose primary mission is to hear and decide appeals by aggrieved civil service employees and those seeking appointment as civil service employees.  As such, we have no records responsive to your request. You may wish to consider reaching out to the Commonwealth’s Public Employee Retirement Administration Commission (PERAC) to see whether they might have the requested records.  You may file a public records request with PERAC at the following link:  Submit a Public Records Request to PERAC | Mass.gov

 

If you wish to challenge any aspect of this response, you may appeal to the Supervisor of Public Records following the procedure set forth in 950 C.M.R. 32.08, a copy of which is available at http://www.mass.gov/courts/case-legal-res/law-lib/laws-by-source/cmr/. You may also file a civil action in accordance with M.G.L. c. 66, 10A.
