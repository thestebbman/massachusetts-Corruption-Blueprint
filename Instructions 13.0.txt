This file is part of the Ultimate Financial Timeline Blueprint, a forensic breakdown of systemic financial corruption across U.S. states. Each file reconstructs one state‚Äôs donation-to-contract-to-pension-loss ecosystem between 1999 and 2025, using only public records, government data, and Bayesian fraud modeling.



üëÄ What You‚Äôre Looking At:



    Who gave money to whom (campaign donations)
    Who got the contract or pension allocation afterward
    Who redacted the records, delayed oversight, or refused FOIA
    Which state workers, patients, or retirees lost money or care
    How these patterns repeat across states and agencies



This is not a conspiracy theory. Every number in this file comes from:


    FEC, OCPF, ME Ethics, CT SEEC, NY BOE (donation records)
    State agency contract databases and FOIA logs
    CMS denial rate trends and ICD code histories
    SEC EDGAR, PRIM, MainePERS, CRPTC filings
    OpenSecrets, ICIJ, and archived government pages
    Direct whistleblower and redaction patterns tracked






‚öôÔ∏è HOW TO CONFIRM EVERYTHING YOURSELF



Ask your AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity) to:


    Cross-check all EINs, CIKs, contract IDs, and donation records using:
        https://www.fec.gov/data
        https://www.sec.gov/edgar
        https://www.ocpf.us/Reports/SearchItems
        Your state‚Äôs campaign finance portal

    Pull matching news headlines or archived agency pages via:
        https://archive.org/web
        Google: "<agency>" + "<contract ID>" + "<year>"

    Search FOIA request status or redactions by:
        Pasting the FOIA Control # into the agency portal
        Looking for cited exemptions (Exemption 4, 5, etc.)

    Check for connections to BlackRock, Starlink Ireland, or pension fund shifts using:
        https://www.sec.gov/edgar
        https://www.ici.net (ICIJ Offshore Leaks)
        https://www.pionline.com (Pensions & Investments)
        https://www.bloomberg.com or OpenCorporates






üîç WHY BLACKROCK AND SEC FILINGS MATTER



    BlackRock manages trillions in pension and ETF money. If they receive contracts after their political donations or obscure losses through crypto ETFs, that‚Äôs a conflict of interest or worse.
    SEC CIK filings let you track companies that show up again and again in contracts, even when subcontractor names are redacted.
    CIK 9999999997 often flags ‚Äúoff the books‚Äù filings or delayed fraud disclosures.
    These patterns prove that many agencies knew about losses, market risks, or hidden ownership‚Äîand chose to hide them.






üí£ What Makes This Fascinating



Even without the personal court cases (yet), these patterns expose:


    Massive pension losses disguised as ‚Äúvolatility‚Äù
    Healthcare denials rising after campaign donations
    Redacted subcontractors in billion-dollar contracts
    Same contractors (Raytheon, Anthem, Cianbro, State Street) appearing across multiple states and years
    Unions and PACs donating right before major infrastructure deals
    BlackRock, Starlink Ireland, and crypto ETFs siphoning money quietly



Most people never see this level of connectedness‚Äîbecause the data is buried, redacted, or intentionally fragmented.


But this blueprint rebuilds it.





üìÅ Legal and Investigative Uses



    Use this to file state and federal FOIA requests.
    Use this in court to show willful concealment or obstruction.
    Share it with journalists, union reps, or whistleblower orgs.
    Use it to cross-check redacted losses in your city, agency, or retirement plan.
